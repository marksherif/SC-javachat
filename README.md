# Java Chatting App

This is a rudimentary, multi-threaded, dual-server chatting application built from the ground up using Java and Java sockets and a simple GUI interface to represent a chatting client.

# What you will need

  - Java IDE
  - Thats it really, thats all you need! This is a useless bulletpoint

# Development:
  - Clone the repo
  - Import the project into eclipse
  - Head over to the ```server.java``` file and run it to launch our dual servers
  - Head over to ```client.java``` file and run it to initiate a client connection with the server
  - The rest is self explantory, you can type "help" in the console to see a list of available commands and what they do

Keep in mind that this is a rudimentary chatting application that is meant for educational purposes.
